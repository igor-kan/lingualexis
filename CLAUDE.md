- **Accent Coaching**: Comparative analysis with native speaker patterns
- **Progress Tracking**: Pronunciation improvement metrics and goals
- **Interactive Feedback**: Visual and audio guidance for correction

#### Adaptive Content Generation
- **Personalized Curriculum**: Goal-based and proficiency-adapted learning paths
- **Interest Integration**: Context-relevant examples based on user preferences
- **Cultural Context**: Language learning with cultural immersion elements
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Real-time content adjustment based on performance

#### NLP & Conversation AI
- **AI Conversation Partners**: Interactive practice with simulated native speakers
- **Grammar Analysis**: Real-time corrections with contextual explanations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Language structure learning through contextual examples
- **Contextual Learning**: Situation-based vocabulary and phrase acquisition

#### Gamified Learning Intelligence
- **Dynamic Achievements**: Learning pattern-based reward systems
- **Peer Matching**: AI-powered competitive learning and social features
- **Progress Gamification**: XP, levels, and milestone achievement systems

## TypeScript Architecture

### Core Interfaces
```typescript
interface LinguaLexisAIService {
  calculateNextReview(word: Vocabulary, performance: Performance[]): Promise<ReviewSchedule>;
  analyzePronunciation(audio: AudioData, target: string): Promise<PronunciationAnalysis>;
  generatePersonalizedContent(user: UserProfile, topic: string): Promise<LearningContent>;
  processConversationInput(input: string, context: ConversationContext): Promise<AIResponse>;
}

interface UserProfile {
  targetLanguages: Language[];
  proficiencyLevels: Record<string, ProficiencyLevel>;
  learningGoals: LearningGoal[];
  learningStyle: LearningStyle;
  interests: Topic[];
  studySchedule: SchedulePreference;
}

interface LearningContent {
  type: 'vocabulary' | 'grammar' | 'conversation' | 'pronunciation';
  difficulty: ProficiencyLevel;
  content: ContentItem[];
  exercises: Exercise[];
  culturalContext?: CulturalNote[];
}
```

### Planned Components
- `components/SpacedRepetitionSystem.tsx` - Intelligent SRS implementation
- `components/PronunciationCoach.tsx` - Real-time speech analysis and coaching
- `components/ConversationPartner.tsx` - AI conversation practice interface
- `components/AdaptiveCurriculum.tsx` - Personalized learning path generation
- `components/ProgressAnalytics.tsx` - Comprehensive learning analytics dashboard
